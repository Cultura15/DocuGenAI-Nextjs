# Diva AI App Documentation Generator Next.js Project

## Overview

**Diva AI App Documentation Generator** is a Next.js-based web application designed to help developers and users automatically generate professional-quality documentation. It leverages OpenAI to generate documentation content for **Developer Setup Guides** and **User Guides**, with the ability to output in both **Markdown** (`.md`) and **Word Document** (`.docx`) formats.

This project is still a work-in-progress, being developed as a solo effort. The goal is to streamline the documentation process and help developers save time when creating well-structured documentation for their apps, tools, or services.

The generated documentation will be in a clean, professional format that can be downloaded and shared with team members, clients, or users.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Documentation Generation**: Easily generate developer and user guide docs using AI-powered text generation.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Download the generated documentation as a Markdown (.md) or Word (.docx) file.
- **Real-time Preview**: View the generated documentation live in your browser.
- **Customizable**: Although it's AI-powered, you can adjust and tweak the generated content to fit your needs.

This project is mainly built for fun and experimentation but with a clear goal of creating a useful tool for developers and teams who need quick and easy documentation generation.

## Getting Started

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

You can begin editing the main page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. Changes are reflected in real time as you save the file.

This project uses `next/font` to optimize and load the Geist font from Vercel.
